Its essay travel written by me.
My travel north voyage!
Travels to North, i saw differents essencials moments, which haven't seen earlier! 
Calm and no wind. Sky is blue-purple.Moonhalo as the rainbow! Moonhalo full of different colours -purple, green, blue and juicy colours!
Мoonhalo and plays of shadow and light, shows theuneven of her surface!.
The moonlight danced! 
North februar was warmer than i expected!
